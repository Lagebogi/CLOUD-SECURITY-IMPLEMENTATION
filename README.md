*DESCIRPTION* : In this assignment, I successfully implemented security best practices on AWS by configuring IAM policies, securing S3 storage, and enabling data encryption. I started by creating and applying an IAM policy to enforce secure access to an S3 bucket, restricting unencrypted connections using a condition that denies access if aws:SecureTransport is false. Next, I set up an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key to enable encryption for sensitive data. I then configured S3 bucket encryption to automatically encrypt all newly uploaded objects using the KMS key. Additionally, I assigned appropriate IAM permissions to ensure that only authorized users and services could manage and use the encryption key. Finally, I verified the setup by testing access controls and encryption, ensuring compliance with security policies. The assignment deliverables include the configured security settings and a report detailing the implementation steps.
